# Simple Network Application - P2P File Sharing

## Application overview
### Tracker
A centralized tracker keeps track of which peers are connected and storing what files.

### Peer
- Through tracker protocol, a peer informs the tracker as to what files and their encoded data are contained in its local repository.
- When a peer requires a file that does not belong to its repository, a request is sent to the tracker. The tracker sends a response to that peer which other peers keep the required file. Then the peer can directly connect to another peer to get the data of the file.
- Multiple peers could be downloading different files from a target peer at a given point in time.
